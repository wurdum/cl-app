# Command Line Application example

This is an example of how an application can be built using [System.CommandLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/) libraries.

The application has in-built support of `--help` and `--version` options. Also, the following command line arguments can be applied:

```
./ClApp
./ClApp sub1
./ClApp sub1 --opt1 42
./ClApp sub1 --opt1 42 --opt2 "text input"
```
